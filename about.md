Hi!

I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Data Science. 

I've interned at **Twitter** in summer 2019, where I got to work on some cool stuff involving Scala and Tensorflow. I used to work at **HackerRank** as a full stack developer. I had also setup web infrastructure for **Zilliqa**, an innovative blockchain and smart contract platform. I received my undergraduate degree in 2016 from **BITS Pilani**.

I like to keep up with shiny new tech and have dipped my toes in a wide range of technologies, including web programming, distributed algorithms, big data systems, VR frameworks, blockchain architectures, machine learning, natural language processing and deep neural networks. I'm also interested in entrepreneurship and startups, and am probably working on a stealth startup right now.

I've started this blog to keep track of what I'm learning technically. Email me with any questions or just to say hi at [siddharthasahai99@gmail.com](mailto:siddharthasahai99@gmail.com).
