Hi!

I currently work as a ML engineer at Twitter cortex. I graduated with a masters degree from the University of Texas at Dallas, majoring in Data Science. 

I previously used to work at **HackerRank** as a full stack developer. I've also worked on web wallets & solidity contracts for **Zilliqa**, an innovative blockchain and smart contract platform. I received my undergraduate degree in 2016 from **BITS Pilani**.

I like to keep up with shiny new tech and have dipped my toes in a wide range of technologies, including the web, distributed algorithms, big data systems, VR frameworks, blockchain architectures, machine learning, natural language processing and deep neural networks & federated learning. I'm also interested in entrepreneurship and startups, and love playing music when I get saturated of the tech world.

I've started this blog to keep track of things I've learnt, both technical or personal. Email me with any questions or just to say hi at [siddharthasahai99@gmail.com](mailto:siddharthasahai99@gmail.com).
